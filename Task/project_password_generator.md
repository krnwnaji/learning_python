# Password Generator Project

Sure! Here's a simple Python project that you can try:

Project Title: Password Generator

Project Description: In this project, you'll create a simple password generator that can generate random passwords based on certain criteria such as length, complexity, and character types.

Steps to follow:

1. Ask the user to input the length of the password they want to generate.
2. Ask the user to choose the complexity level of the password (e.g. easy, medium, hard) or allow them to set the number of each type of character they want in the password (e.g. number of uppercase letters, number of lowercase letters, number of digits, number of special characters).
3. Generate a random password based on the user's input.
4. Display the password to the user.

Study Case:

Let's consider a scenario where a company wants to create a new system to generate secure passwords for their employees' accounts. They want the passwords to be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. They also want the employees to be able to choose the complexity level of the password (easy, medium, or hard).

To fulfill the company's requirements, you can create a Python program that:

1. Asks the user to input the length of the password they want to generate (minimum 12).
2. Asks the user to choose the complexity level of the password (easy, medium, or hard).
3. Generates a random password based on the user's input.
4. Displays the password to the user.

Here's some code to get you started:

```python
import random
import string

def generate_password(length, complexity):
    lowercase_letters = string.ascii_lowercase
    uppercase_letters = string.ascii_uppercase
    digits = string.digits
    special_chars = string.punctuation

    if complexity == "easy":
        pool = lowercase_letters + digits
    elif complexity == "medium":
        pool = lowercase_letters + uppercase_letters + digits
    else:
        pool = lowercase_letters + uppercase_letters + digits + special_chars

    password = "".join(random.sample(pool, length))

    return password

length = int(input("Enter the length of the password you want to generate: "))
complexity = input("Enter the complexity level (easy, medium, hard): ")

password = generate_password(length, complexity)
print("Your password is:", password)
```

This code uses the `string` module to define the different character types that can be included in the password, and the `random` module to generate a random password based on the user's input. The `generate_password()` function takes two parameters (length and complexity) and returns a randomly generated password. The main program prompts the user for input, generates the password, and displays it to the user.
